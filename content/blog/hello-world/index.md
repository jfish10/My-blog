This is my first post on my new blog! Please excuse any mistakes or inconsistencies these first few posts
as I get used to writing in markdown - https://www.markdownguide.org/.

There are a ton of interesting and inspiring posts in the pipeline - stay tuned!


- Here's an example of adding a feature via markdown!
```js
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello World!")
}
```
